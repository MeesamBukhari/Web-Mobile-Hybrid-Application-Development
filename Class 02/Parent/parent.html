    <p>In 1992, Tim Berners-Lee circulated a document titled “HTML Tags,” which outlined just 20 tags, 
        many of which are now obsolete or have taken other forms. The first surviving tag to be defined
         in the document, after the crucial anchor tag, is the paragraph tag. It wasn’t until 1993 that 
         a discussion emerged on the proposed image tag.</p>

    <p>Quantum computing began in the early 1980s, when physicist Paul Benioff proposed a quantum 
        mechanical model of the Turing machine.Richard Feynman and Yuri Manin later suggested
         that a quantum computer had the potential to simulate things that a classical computer could
          not.In 1994, Peter Shor developed a quantum algorithm for factoring integers that had 
          the potential to decrypt RSA-encrypted communications.Despite ongoing experimental progress
           since the late 1990s, most researchers believe that "fault-tolerant quantum computing [is] 
           still a rather distant dream."In recent years, investment into quantum computing research 
           has increased in both the public and private sector.On 23 October 2019, Google AI, in 
           partnership with the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), published a 
           paper in which they claimed to have achieved quantum supremacy.While some have disputed 
           this claim, it is still a significant milestone in the history of quantum computing.</p>

    <p>GitHub, Inc. is a United States-based global company that provides hosting for software development 
        version control using Git. In 2018, it became a subsidiary of Microsoft for US$7.5 billion.It offers the 
        distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git, plus its own 
        features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, 
        feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.</p>
